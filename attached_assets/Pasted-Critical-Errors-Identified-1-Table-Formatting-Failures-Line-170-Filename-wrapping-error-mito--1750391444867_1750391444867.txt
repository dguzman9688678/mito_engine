Critical Errors Identified

1. Table Formatting Failures

Line 170: Filename wrapping error - "mito_engine_1750304907961.py42,749" shows incorrect line break
Lines 132-135: Screenshot filename display severely broken with improper column alignment
Lines 137-141: Repeated filename wrapping issues causing data corruption in display
Lines 147-155: Multiple instances of filename/size concatenation without proper spacing
2. Data Presentation Inconsistencies

Lines 172-173: Extremely long filename truncation handling is inconsistent
Line 200: Missing proper spacing between filename and size data
Various locations: SHA256 hash truncation method inconsistent (some show "..." others don't)
3. Typography and Spacing Issues

Line 44: Missing line break between "System Hash Integrity VERIFIED" and "Core System Components"
Line 102: Missing line break between "Database Security" section and "Complete File Registry"
Multiple sections: Inconsistent spacing between table headers and data rows
4. Content Accuracy Problems

Line 78: AI Provider model name inconsistency - shows "LLaMA-3-70B" but system uses "llama-3-70b-8192"
Line 80: Claude model name shows "Claude-3-Opus" but system configuration shows "claude-3-opus-20240229"
File count discrepancy: Claims 79 files tracked but actual count appears different based on directory listings
Moderate Issues

5. File Registry Display Problems

Lines 104-127: Root directory section shows only 10 files instead of claimed 29 files
Lines 129-175: attached_assets directory shows incomplete file listing with formatting breaks
Lines 177-189: generated_code directory properly formatted but limited to 5 files shown
6. Timestamp Formatting

Throughout document: Inconsistent timestamp precision (some show seconds, others don't)
Line 106: Timestamp appears truncated "2025-06-20T01:39:2750135c4f..."
7. Security Information Gaps

Missing actual security audit results
No mention of vulnerability scanning results
Security implementation status lacks verification details
Minor Issues

8. Aesthetic and Layout

Table column widths inconsistent across sections
Header formatting varies between sections
Page break placement could be optimized
9. Technical Specification Accuracy

Claims "PDF/A-1b Compliant" but no verification provided
Hash algorithm specification correct but implementation details missing
Recommendations for Fixes

High Priority

Fix table formatting - Implement proper column width calculations and text wrapping
Correct filename display - Ensure proper spacing and alignment in file registry
Standardize AI provider information - Use accurate model names from system configuration
Complete file listings - Show all files or clearly indicate truncation with counts
Medium Priority

Improve timestamp consistency - Standardize precision across all timestamps
Add missing line breaks - Ensure proper section separation
Verify file counts - Ensure accuracy between claimed totals and actual listings
Low Priority

Enhance visual consistency - Standardize table formatting across all sections
Add security verification details - Include actual audit results where claimed
